# Assignments

There are four assignments, worth a total of 26 points.

Assignments A1 and A2 are to be completed individually. You may speak to your classmates about the ideas, but are not allowed to use one another's writing or one another's code.

Assignments A3 and A4 are group assignments. You may complete these in groups as large as three. Your group must come from the same tutorial.

Note: if you talk with a classmate about the assignments, you should list them in an *Acknowledgements* section of your submission.

## A0: Slack Introduction

In this assignment, your task is to join the SENG301 Slack chat [https://seng301.slack.com](https://seng301.slack.com), and introduce yourself.

* Create a Slack account
* Join https://seng301.slack.com with this link: [https://seng301.slack.com/signup](sign up)
* Put a picture of yourself in your account (this is important to me)
* Post a message in the #profiles channel with your name, why you are taking this course, something that interests you, and your desired super power (or a super power you have).

## A1: Implementation to Specification [(details)](a1.md)

You are given a specification and a partially working piece of (stubbed) code. Your job is to write the code to fulfill the test specification with (likely) only a partial understanding of the system as a whole.

## A2: Handling Events and Modeling Systems with Diagrams [(details)](a2.md)

The client already has some hardware that you're supposed to build against, and the specification has changed! Doh! Your job is to modify the code so that it fulfills the new specification. You will also sketch models of both the old and new system as documentation of the changes that have been made so that the new intern can get up to speed quickly.

## A3: Designing Automated Tests (group)

As a group, you need to build an automated test suite for the system. You have a set of existing tests that are normally run manually, and need to translate these into automated tests that can be run from a test harness.

## A4: Redesigning for the Future (group)

The client is interested in "future-proofing" their tool. Your team must redesign (and recode) some aspects of the system to account for this future proofing. You will need to document the redesign, and design a test plan for the changes.

## No Late Assignments

I do not accept late assignments. They are due on the day at the time specified.

Extremely extenuating circumstances may be considered, but you will need to make an appointment with me for office hours, and bring along your calendar.
