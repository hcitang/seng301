# About SENG 301

## Description

_Calendar Description:_ Software Analysis and Design - Introduction to developing large-scale, quality software, from analysis of requirements, through design, implementation, and testing. Introduction to design for non-functional properties of software. Emphasis on individual skills.

_Tony's Goal:_ This is our opportunity to begin getting prepped for software engineering jobs in the real world. This means introducing you to the terminology and processes that you will encounter, the challenges that come with a real job (i.e. overwhelming amounts of code), and most importantly -- tools to help to resolve these challenges. You will have learning experiences that help you to understand these concepts by practicing them. As a software engineer, part of demonstrating your knowledge will be _through_ building software. This is not an easy class.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will:

* Implement a small to medium-scale software system conforming to a design.

* Design a small- to medium-scale software system that conforms to a given description.

* Implement and to execute an automated test suite.

* Design and to justify a test plan.

* Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of a given design.

* Model a small- to medium-scale software system to represent the relevant aspects in a specified context.

* Modify an existing design and its implementation in order to achieve a specified effect.

By the end of the course, you will have been exposed to the following tools:

* C#, .NET Framework, and maybe .NET Core: [4th most popular programming language according TIOBE](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/). C# is similar to Java, but has a lot of nice syntactic sugar pieces that make it nicer to deal with. The .NET Framework has some niceness that we will get to explore in the assignments.
* Visual Studio (IDE + debugger): This is one of the most important things to become familiar with -- how to use the development environment to support your development process. Specifically, we will devote time in tutorial to get you accustomed to using the debugger, and thinking about how to debug code.
* NUnit: An automated test suite that is prototypical of most automated testing tools out there. In real life, the vast majority of testing is done in an automated way. You will learn how to do it, too.
* GitHub: A code repository is one of the most important basic tools used by professional developers (e.g. RCS, CVS, SVN, git, ...). We will use it as a "prototypical" code repository tool. You will learn to use GitHub as it is a popular online "public" repository, and also to start your own GitHub profile (one of the main ways that prospective employers evaluate you!).
* Slack: Developers use "new hotness" tools all the time to facilitate communication. We're going to use Slack because it's the latest new hotness.

## Evaluation

Note: This is tentative, and superceded by the course syllabus.

| Component | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Lab Exercises | 10% |
| Assignments | 26% |
| Quizzes | 14% |
| Midterm (Feb 16) | 20% |
| Final (TBD) | 30% |

Lab exercises are graded based on completion. These are in-tutorial labs where you will practice the concrete skills in a practical context. Some of these will be on D2L, while others will be activities led by your TA. In all cases, unless specified by the TA, they can be completed as groups.

[Assignments](assignments.md) are practical applications of the lessons from class. You will build and modify applications based on requirements. The first two of these are individual assignments, the latter two are group assignments.

Quizzes are quick in-lecture assessments of your retention of knowledge. They will be announced at least one lecture in advance.

Midterm and Final are closed-book exams where your knowledge retention, reasoning and written communication skills will be assessed.
